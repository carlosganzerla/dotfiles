# Dot files

This repo contains my dotfiles, and some other customizable programs like DWM
and DWMBlocks. It also contain my Arch packages.

## Useful programs

Some stuff so I can remind myself.

- `xrandr`: manages displays
- `dunst`: desktop notifications
- `lf`: file manager
- `notify-send`: test systems notifications
- `stow`: creates symlinks for dotfiles

## Install

To install the dotfiles, run `stow */` on the proejct root.
To install dwm/dwmblocks, just go on `programs/{dwm, dwmblocks}` and run `sudo
make install`.
